# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

There are two kind of repositories:
1.A remote repository is hosted on a remote, or off-site, server that is shared among multiple team members.
2.A local repository is hosted on a local machine for an individual user.

Ways to create a repository
There are two ways to create a local repository on your machine: you can create a new repository from scratch using a file folder on your computer, or you can clone an existing repository.

Git init
You can create a new repo from scratch using the git init command. It can be used to introduce Git into an existing, unversioned project so that you can start tracking changes.

Git clone
You can copy a remote repository onto your local machine using the git clone command. By default, git clone will automatically set up a local master branch that tracks the remote master branch it was cloned from.
